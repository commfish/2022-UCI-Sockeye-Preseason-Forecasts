# 2022-UCI-Sockeye-Preseason-Forecasts
UCI sockeye preseason forecasts include Fish Creek, Kenai River, Kasilof River, and Susitna River. The original codes, except Susitna River, were SAS progams written by Mark Willett. Susitna stock was originally in Excel. Xinxian Zhang modified and converted them to R cripts, which has been used since 2021.
